# Colorado River Basin Dashboard Help

## Overview
This dashboard provides interactive visualizations of various hydrological data sources for the Colorado River Basin. All visualizations are generated directly from raw data files, ensuring up-to-date and accurate analysis.

## Data Sources

### SMAP (Soil Moisture Active Passive)
- Source: NASA SMAP L4 Global 9km EASE-Grid Surface and Root Zone Soil Moisture
- Temporal Coverage: 2015-present
- Spatial Resolution: 9km
- Variables: Surface and Root Zone Soil Moisture

### GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment)
- Source: NASA/GFZ GRACE and GRACE-FO Mascon Solutions
- Temporal Coverage: 2002-present
- Spatial Resolution: ~300km
- Variables: Terrestrial Water Storage Changes

### VIC (Variable Infiltration Capacity) Model
- Source: VIC Model Outputs
- Temporal Coverage: 1982-present
- Spatial Resolution: 4km
- Variables: Snow Water Equivalent, Soil Moisture, Precipitation, Temperature

### PRISM (Parameter-elevation Regressions on Independent Slopes Model)
- Source: PRISM Climate Group
- Temporal Coverage: 1982-present
- Spatial Resolution: 4km
- Variables: Precipitation, Temperature

## Tab Descriptions
