# Colorado River Basin Monitoring Dashboard Documentation

## Overview
The Colorado River Basin Monitoring Dashboard provides real-time monitoring and analysis of various hydrological parameters across the Colorado River Basin. This dashboard integrates data from multiple sources including SNOTEL stations, VIC model outputs, SMAP soil moisture measurements, and GRACE terrestrial water storage data.

## Features

### Overview Tab
- Interactive basin map showing key features and boundaries
- Current conditions display
- Recent trends visualization

### Snow Analysis Tab
- Spatial distribution of snow water equivalent (SWE)
- Time series analysis of SNOTEL station data
- Statistical analysis of snow metrics

### Soil Moisture Tab
- Spatial distribution of soil moisture
- Time series analysis of SMAP and VIC model data
- Statistical analysis of soil moisture patterns

### Water Storage Tab
- GRACE terrestrial water storage visualization
- Time series analysis of water storage changes
- Statistical analysis of storage trends

### Historical Analysis Tab
- Long-term trend analysis
- Comparison tools for different time periods
- Statistical analysis of historical patterns
