# Framework Overview

This dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis framework for the Colorado River Basin (CRB) hydrology based on the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model simulations.

## Analysis Components

### 1. Watershed Analyses
- **Annual Analysis**: Examine long-term patterns and changes in hydrological variables
- **Monthly Analysis**: Study seasonal variations and timing shifts in water resources

### 2. Spatial Analyses
- Explore spatial distributions of hydrological variables
- Compare patterns across different regions of the basin
- Analyze temporal variations in spatial patterns

## Data Sources

### VIC Model
- Spatial Resolution: 4km
- Temporal Resolution: Daily
- Period: 1982-2024
- Variables: Precipitation, Evapotranspiration, Runoff, Snow Water Equivalent, etc.

### Basin Delineation
- HUC10 Watersheds
- Major Sub-basins
- Upper and Lower Basin divisions

## Analysis Features

### 1. Variable Selection
- Hydrological Variables (SWE, Runoff, etc.)
- Efficiency Metrics (Supply, Runoff efficiency)
- Climate Variables (Temperature, Evapotranspiration)

### 2. Temporal Scales
- Annual (Oct-Sep)
- Cool-Season (Oct-Mar)
- Warm-Season (Apr-Sep)

### 3. Spatial Regions
- Basin-wide
- Upper/Lower Basin
- Individual Sub-basins

### 4. Analysis Types
- Time Series Analysis
- Spatial Distribution
- Seasonal Patterns
- Trend Analysis
