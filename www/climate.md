# Climate Projections

## Overview
The climate data used in this analysis comes from downscaled general circulation model (GCM) products and includes two emissions scenarios (Representative Concentration Pathways 4.5 and 8.5, or R45 and R85).

## Data Sources

### PRISM Climate Data
- Spatial Resolution: 4km
- Temporal Resolution: Daily
- Period: 1982-2024
- Variables: Temperature, Precipitation

### Climate Scenarios

#### 1. Historical (1982-2005)
- Baseline period for comparisons
- Observed climate conditions
- Natural variability

#### 2. Near-Future (2006-2040)
- RCP 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios
- Moderate to high emissions
- Increasing temperatures

#### 3. Mid-Century (2041-2070)
- Continued warming
- Precipitation changes
- Seasonal shifts
