# Watersheds

## Basin Overview

The Colorado River Basin encompasses approximately 246,000 square miles (637,000 square kilometers) across seven U.S. states and Mexico. The basin is divided into several major watersheds and sub-basins for analysis and management purposes.

## Major Divisions

### 1. Upper Basin
- Green River
- Upper Colorado
- San Juan
- Includes headwaters in Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, and New Mexico
- Major reservoirs: Flaming Gorge, Blue Mesa, Navajo

### 2. Lower Basin
- Glen Canyon
- Grand Canyon
- Lower Colorado
- Gila River
- Major reservoirs: Lake Powell, Lake Mead
- Includes parts of Arizona, Nevada, and California

## Watershed Characteristics

### 1. Elevation
- Range: 0-14,000 feet (0-4,300 meters)
- Mean: 5,500 feet (1,676 meters)
- Distribution by region
- Impact on hydrology

### 2. Land Cover
- Forest types
- Grassland
- Desert
- Agricultural areas
- Urban development

### 3. Climate Zones
- Alpine
- Semi-arid
- Desert
- Seasonal patterns
- Temperature gradients

## Analysis Units

### 1. HUC10 Watersheds
- Number: 100+
- Average size: 2,400 square miles

- Tribal rights
- International treaties

### 2. Infrastructure
- Dams and reservoirs
- Diversions
- Power generation
- Delivery systems

### 3. Environmental Flows
- Minimum flows
- Habitat requirements
- Species protection
- Ecosystem services
